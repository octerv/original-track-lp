        <div class="section-content">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting Original Track.<br />
            By using our service, you agree to these terms of service.<br />
            Please read them carefully.
          </p>

          <h2>Service Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Original Track provides music track separation and analysis
            services.<br />
            The use of our services for illegal purposes is prohibited.<br />
            If it is found that our service is being used to infringe the rights
            of others, we may suspend your account without prior
            verification.<br />
            In such cases, no refunds will be provided for any remaining
            subscription fees.
          </p>

          <h2>Compliance with Laws</h2>
          <p>
            Users agree to comply with all local, national, and international
            laws, regulations, and ordinances applicable to the use of our
            service.<br />
            This includes copyright laws, privacy laws, export control laws, and
            other laws related to the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are responsible for respecting the copyrights of the content
            accessed or used through our service and must avoid illegal use.<br />
            We are not responsible for any illegal actions or law violations
            committed by users.
          </p>

          <h2>Prohibition of Misuse of Services</h2>
          <p>
            Our audio separation and analysis features must only be used for
            legitimate purposes.<br />
            The following actions violate our terms of service and may be
            prohibited by law:<br />
            - Separating or analyzing audio for which you do not have rights and
            using the resulting data for commercial purposes.<br />
            - Separating or analyzing audio for which you do not have rights and
            publishing the resulting data on the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such actions may be considered copyright infringement, and our
            service does not tolerate such illegal activities.<br />
            Users must ensure that they only use audio for which they have
            rights and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>

          <h2>Account Suspension</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend user accounts if there is suspicion of illegal
            activity or violation of our service terms.<br />
            Such measures may be applied in situations including, but not
            limited to:<br />
            - Suspicion of illegal activity: If a user is suspected of using our
            service for illegal actions.<br />
            - Harm to the Service: If a user's actions are deemed harmful to the
            operation of the service or other users.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases, we may suspend accounts without prior warning or
            explanation.<br />
            Once an account is suspended, the user must immediately cease using
            our service, and no refunds will be provided for unused service
            periods or subscription fees.<br />
            We are not obligated to provide detailed explanations for account
            suspensions based on operational decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>Account and Security</h2>
          <p>
            Users are responsible for securing their own accounts.<br />
            If unauthorized use is discovered, it should be reported to us
            immediately.
          </p>

          <h2>File Management and Deletion</h2>
          <p>
            The following arrangements apply to files uploaded through our
            service:<br />
            - Uploaded files will be automatically deleted after 180 days. This
            includes separated files.<br />
            - Users can delete uploaded files from their accounts at any time.
            This also deletes separated files.<br />
            - There is no way to recover files that have been deleted by our
            service or by users. Please manage your files carefully.
          </p>

          <h2>File Management and Separation Quality Notice</h2>
          <p>
            Please note the following points regarding files uploaded through
            our service:<br />
            - The quality of separation depends on the characteristics of the
            uploaded audio source. Different sources may yield different
            results.<br />
            - The time required for the separation process may vary depending on
            the length of the uploaded audio source. It is necessary to wait
            until the process is complete.<br />
            - There is no limit on the duration of the audio source, but it will
            be split every 8 minutes for separation processing and
            recombination, which may result in interruptions in the sound.<br />
            - We cannot guarantee that every audio source can be completely
            separated. Please use our service with this in mind.
          </p>

          <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
          <h4>User Content</h4>
          <p>
            Users retain all intellectual property rights for the content they
            upload using our service.<br />
            Users may only upload content for which they have rights.<br />
            For separated data generated through our service (e.g., separated
            music tracks), if the user holds the rights to the original content,
            they also retain the rights to the separated data. Users are free to
            use these separated data.
          </p>
          <h4>Service Content</h4>
          <p>
            Content provided by Original Track, such as website design,
            software, text, and graphics, is owned by us or our licensors and is
            protected by intellectual property laws.<br />
            These elements may not be copied, distributed, displayed, or used
            without our explicit permission.
          </p>

          <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

            We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
            consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of our
            service, regardless of the cause or type of damage.<br />
            This includes, but is not limited to, loss of profits, data loss,
            and damages resulting from the inability to use the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this does not apply to damages caused by our intentional
            misconduct or gross negligence. Also, these limitations of liability
            do not apply where prohibited by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users understand and assume the risks associated with using our
